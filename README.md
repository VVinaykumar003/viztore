# Viztore — Multi-Page Website

A premium SaaS website for **Viztore**, built with Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Framer Motion and Lucide React.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

> Note: `npm run build` requires internet access on first build so Next.js
> can fetch the Poppins font from Google Fonts (via `next/font/google`).

## Pages

| Route            | Description                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                | Home — problem, how it works, features, categories |
| `/for-retailers`   | Retailer-focused product page                  |
| `/for-customers`   | Customer-focused product page                  |
| `/platform`        | Full platform overview                          |
| `/about-us`        | Company story, values, roadmap                  |

Navbar and footer links route between these pages (not same-page anchors).

## Images

Place these files in `public/images/` — placeholders are included so the
site runs out of the box, but swap in your real assets:

- `lightLogo.png` — used on dark/transparent backgrounds (navbar when not
  scrolled, footer)
- `darkLogo.png` — used on white backgrounds (navbar once scrolled)
- `bannerImage.png` — Home hero banner visual
- `mobileImage.png` — Home hero + For Customers app-download phone mockup
